Features
General:
Classes are Vampire, Ghoul, Werewolf, Demon, Priest, and WitchHunter.
All classes have abilities that depend on your power level.
All classes gain power in a certain way.
WitchHunter kill list generate on server start. (Admins can remove players with the command /sn rmTarget)
Class Join/Leave Information:
Each class has a unique event required for joining or leaving.
Joining a Class:
Humans construct special Altars to convert to Vampires, starting with a solid Gold Block.
Humans sometimes convert to Werewolves when dying to wild wolves at night.
Pig Zombies sometimes have the ability to make humans undead rather than just dead.
Any human who shows proper devotion to the Church may become a Priest.
Non-Priest humans who can prove their Supernatural Hunting Abilities by slaying 3 different types of supernaturals without dying will be invited to the WitchHunters' Association.
Humans who enter the Nether covered in dead animal skins (leather armor) and sacrifice themselves to the Inferno will become Demonic.
Leaving a Class:
Vampires construct special Altars to regain their humanity, starting with a solid Lapis Block.
Werewolves must make themselves a Wolfbane potion, starting with an empty Bowl.
Priests merely have to insult the Church by offering Coal to the donations' Altar.
The Holy energy of the Church's Altar will sometimes cleanse a Ghoul and restore their humanity.
Demons who die in icy water while carrying snowballs will find the demonic fire in their blood cooled.
WitchHunters who exhibit extremely poor bow skills (kill themselves) will be removed from the Association.
